/*
You are given an integer array coins of length n which represents the n coins that you own. The value of the ith coin is coins[i]. You can make some value x if you can choose some of your n coins such that their values sum up to x.

Return the maximum number of consecutive integer values that you can make with your coins starting from and including 0.

Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.

 

Example 1:

Input: coins = [1,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
Example 2:

Input: coins = [1,1,1,4]
Output: 8
Explanation: You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
- 2: take [1,1]
- 3: take [1,1,1]
- 4: take [4]
- 5: take [4,1]
- 6: take [4,1,1]
- 7: take [4,1,1,1]
You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,4,10,3,1]
Output: 20
 

Constraints:

coins.length == n
1 <= n <= 4 * 104
1 <= coins[i] <= 4 * 104

/*
 if we reached number i, that means that we can make all values 0...i.
 So, if we add a coin with value j, we can also make values i+1...i+j.

The only case when we can have a gap is the coin value is greater than i + 1.
So we sort the coins to make sure we process smaller coins first.

For example, let's assume that we can make all values 0...7
Adding a '5' allows us to make values 8..12 (7+1...7+5)

class Solution {

		int next = 1;
		for (int c : coins) {
			if (c > next) break;
			else next += c;
